## Overview

Content routing refers to the process of directing data to its intended recipient within a
P2P network. In a traditional client-server network, routing is a straightforward process
because a central authority manages the flow of data. However, in a P2P network, there is
no central authority, so routing becomes more complex.

One of the main challenges of content routing in P2P networks is scalability. As the number
of peers in a network increases, the number of possible routes for data to travel also increases.
This can lead to a situation where the routing table becomes excessively large and difficult to
manage.

Another challenge is fault tolerance. In a centralized network, if the central server goes down,
the entire network goes down. In a P2P network, if a peer goes down, the network can still
function, but losing that peer can create a bottleneck and make routing more difficult.

In general, specific characteristics of P2P networks complicate this process, including:

- The lack of universal orchestration that a central server can provide when
  querying and retrieving content.
- Not having a central directory that contains information about reaching every peer
  in the network.
- The presence of high node churn.
- Creating a resilient, scalable, and optimal routing protocol that is resistant to
- Resistance against Sybil attacks.
- Forward compatibility.

## Content Routing in libp2p

libp2p provides a set of modules for different network-level functionality, including
a content routing interface.

```shell
interface ContentRouting {
 Provide(CID, bool) error
 FindProviders(CID) [Multiaddr]
}
```

In libp2p, content routing is based on a
[Distributed Hash Table (DHT) called Kademlia](../introduction/protocols/kaddht.md). Kademlia assigns
each piece of content a unique identifier and stores the content on the peer whose identifier is
closest to the content's identifier. This allows for efficient routing, reducing the number of possible
routes. The content router is simply an index of the peer serving the content of interest,
and a DHT is used to maintain a P2P index. More information can be found in the
[Kad-DHT content routing document](kaddht.md).

While there are different design approaches for a content routing protocol, such as
Kademlia DHT, DNS, and BitTorrent trackers, the libp2p
documentation will focus on a DHT-based approach that implements the content routing
interface: Kad-DHT-libp2p.
