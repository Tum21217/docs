description: "Stream Multiplexing is a way of sending multiple streams of data over one communication link. It combines multiple signals into one unified signal so it can be transported 'over the wires', then it is demulitiplexed so it can be output and used by separate applications."

## Overview

Stream multiplexing (or stream muxing) is a method to send multiple streams
of data over a single communication link. It combines multiple signals into one
unified signal. The unified signal can then be demultiplexed (or demuxed), where
the output becomes available in an application. This allows
peers to initialize and use the same [transport](../../transports/overview)
connection across the lifetime of their interaction with another peer.

In particular, stream muxing is done to share a single connection using unique port numbers
that distinguish streams between multiple processes (such as kademlia and gossipsub)
used by applications (such as IPFS) to make connection and transmission more efficient.

## Muxers in libp2p

Establishing a libp2p connection can be expensive and take a few round-trips. Peers
should aim to establish a connection once, then reuse that connection by opening a stream,
which has a low overhead and does not impose any latency penalty.

Stream muxers are pluggable in libp2p. A given libp2p host can support several
muxers simultaneously. The stream muxer is negotiated between the two nodes during the
handshake. Having such a negotiation protocol in place allows libp2p to adopt new muxers in
the future while simultaneously keeping backward compatibility with currently deployed
muxers.

Developers writing libp2p applications rarely need to interact with stream multiplexers
directly, except during initial configuration to control which modules are enabled.

libp2p supports two muxers, [mplex](mplex) and [yamux](yamux). libp2p also supports
transports that support native stream muxing, like [QUIC](../transports/quic).
