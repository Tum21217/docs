## Background

While the [identify protocol][spec_identify] lets peers inform each other about their observed network
addresses, however, it is possible that some of these addresses are not accessible from outside the network, as the peer may be located in a private network that is behind a [NAT](overview.md) and therefore unreachable.

To prevent this problem of advertising undialable addresses, libp2p has implemented a protocol called AutoNAT, which allows nodes to determine
whether or not they are behind a NAT.
Furthermore, this lays the foundation for nodes to find a way to improve their connectivity to peers in public networks.

## What is AutoNAT?

AutoNAT allows a node to request other peers to dial its presumed public addresses. If a few of these
dial attempts are successful, the node can be reasonably ascertain that it is not behind a NAT. On the other
hand, if a few of these dial attempts fail, it strongly indicates that a NAT is blocking incoming connections.

The AutoNAT protocol uses the protocol ID `/libp2p/autonat/1.0.0` and involves the exchange of `Dial` and
`DialResponse` messages.

To initiate the protocol, a node sends a `Dial` message to another peer containing
a list of multiaddresses. The peer then attempts to dial these addresses using a different IP and peer ID
than it uses for its regular libp2p connection. If at least one of the dials is successful, the peer sends a
`DialResponse` message with the `ResponseStatus`: `SUCCESS` to the requesting node.

If all dials fail, the peer sends a `DialResponse` message with the `ResponseStatus`: `E_DIAL_ERROR`.
The requesting node can use the response from the peer to determine whether or not it is behind a NAT.

To prevent [certain types of attacks](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3489#section-12.1.1), libp2p implementations of AutoNAT must not dial any multiaddress that
is not based on the IP address of the requesting node AND must not accept dial requests via relayed
connections (because it is not possible to validate a node's IP address that arrives via a relayed connection).

This is to prevent amplification attacks, in which an attacker provides many clients with the same
faked [MAPPED-ADDRESS](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3489#section-11.2.1) that points to the intended target, causing all traffic to be focused on the
target.
